    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Tale is rendered, a little freely, from <i>Trente-six Rencontres de
      Jean du Gogué</i>, in <i>Contes d&rsquo;un Buveur de Bière</i>, par Charles
      Deulin. (Sixième Edition. Paris: Dentu. 1873.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The late M. Deulin told with much humour, and probably with but little
      alteration from oral tradition, the popular tales of his native province.
      The narrative here translated has points in common with a Tongan legend,
      with several ancient French <i>fabliaux</i>, with a Zulu story in Bishop
      Callaway&rsquo;s collection, and with Grimm&rsquo;s <i>Golden Goose</i>.

      IKE the Sultan in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>&mdash;and, sure, you are no
      less despotic&mdash;you have sometimes commanded me to &lsquo;tell you a
      story.&lsquo;It has been my privilege to obey; but, alas! when my toil was
      ended, with a stretch of absolute authority you have bidden me &lsquo;tell you
      another.&lsquo;Truly, Madam, the <i>Ocean of the Streams of Story</i>, whereof
      the Hindoos speak, will speedily be drained dry by your Slave, who now
      presents you with this little Tale, which he has conveyed from French
      Flanders. If it amuses your leisure as much to read, as it has diverted
      mine to translate it, I shall have that enjoyment which attends successful
      enterprise, and I remain,

    <p>
      LONG TIME AGO there lived in French Flanders, at a village called Saint
      Saulve, Valenciennes way, a little cow-boy named Johnny Nut He had no
      father and no mother, and they called him Johnny Nut because he was found
      one fine morning under a walnut-tree. Silly Billy was another name he had,
      for he was just as great an innocent as a calf before it is weaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, never in his living days had Johnny Nut dined on anything better than
      potatoes, and the one thing he wanted in the world was to taste roast
      goose.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0022.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Now, about a dozen miles off, Condé way, there is a village where the
      geese are so grand that all the world talks of nothing but the Hergnies
      geese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I grow up,&rsquo; said Johnny, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Hergnies and eat goose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      So, at long and at last, one autumn evening he left the cows in the lurch,
      and off he went, without beat of drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, whether he came back as poor as he started, and what a great love of
      roast goose brought Silly Billy to, that&rsquo;s what we are going to tell you!
    </p>
    <p>
      So Johnny Nut followed his nose, and asked his way, and at nightfall he
      reached the village of Escau-bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t show me the way to Hergnies, mother?&rsquo; cried Johnny to the
      farmer&rsquo;s wife, who was just sitting down to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I can, my son, but you are out late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you in such a hurry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mother, who is in a hurry if not me? These ten years I&rsquo;ve been dying
      to taste roast goose, so don&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s no time to waste.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer&rsquo;s wife stared at him with all her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do they call you?&rsquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silly Billy,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, <i>don&rsquo;t I see</i>.
</p>
    <p>
&lsquo;Yes, I see,&rsquo; said the woman, laughing to his very
      face. &lsquo;Listen, my lad! You are big, and strong, and you seem honest. Now
      Jim, our man, is off on the King&rsquo;s wars. Will you take his place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me taste roast goose?&rsquo;

    <p>
      &lsquo;On Sunday, as sure as sure, you shall have your fill of goose; I have to
      send some one to Hergnies, to my cousin&rsquo;s, to-morrow. You shall start, at
      peep of day, and bring me a good fat goose. We&rsquo;ll dine off him when we
      come back from the fair at the next town. Does that suit you, my son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s just the thing for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come to supper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And to supper went Johnny Nut, with such an appetite that he scarcely had
      time to say grace.

      EXT day was a Saturday, and the farmer&rsquo;s wife went to waken Johnny in the
      stable-loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, up with you!&rsquo; says she, shaking him. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the cock
      crowing?&rsquo; So she gave him a big bowl of coffee, and <i>such</i> a chunk of
      bread; and showed him the way, and sent him off, saying, &lsquo;Mind you ask for
      my cousin&rsquo;s mill, and bring me the goose, and seven bushels of flour, and
      a pint of seed corn.&rsquo;

      &lsquo;Seven bushels, and one pint,&rsquo; &lsquo;Seven bushels, and one pint&rsquo;&mdash;for,
      not being very clever, he was afraid he might forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went on saying this, he met a farmer, who was counting up how much
      his field should bring him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Seven</i> bushels, indeed!&rsquo; said the farmer. &lsquo;Let a hundred come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this puzzled Johnny Silly Billy, for he had never room in his head for
      more than one idea at a time; so he went on his way, repeating,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let a hundred come! let a hundred come!&rsquo;

    <p>
      Well, as Johnny crossed a wood, there sat a shepherd, as red as scarlet,
      and as proud as a peacock that has laid an egg; and all because his dog
      had just killed a wolf that was after the lambs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let a hundred of them come! let a hundred of them come!&rsquo; sang out Johnny
      Nut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean, you fool?&rsquo; says the shepherd, &lsquo;with your <i>Let a
      hundred them come!</i> A hundred, indeed! Rather say, <i>There&rsquo;s another
      caught and done for!</i>&rsquo;

      &lsquo;Caught and done for! Meaning <i>me</i>!&rsquo; says the gay bridegroom; and he
      tucked up his shirtsleeves to give Johnny one in the eye. But the
      bridesmaid, who did not want a quarrel, gave Johnny a push, and said to
      him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Idiot, say rather, &ldquo;Let everybody follow a good example.&rdquo;&rsquo;

      It was all one to Johnny, and off he went, shouting&mdash;

    <p>
      &lsquo;Let every one follow this good example!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he left the village, and he went, and went and better went, till he
      came to a house on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman had caught a poor tramp, whom he charged with burning the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Let everyone follow this good example</i>!&rsquo; shouted Johnny, never
      thinking of anything but roast goose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, you vagabond! You incite the populace to arson and
      fire-raising!&rsquo; cries the policeman, who was by way of being à great
      lawyer.

    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say, &ldquo;Heaven help you to put the fire out,&rdquo;&rsquo; whispered one of the
      firemen; and Johnny said so, and off he went, the old way, crying&mdash;

      OHNNY was not dead; Fortune had other adventures in store for Johnny. A
      farmer came out with his men, and carried him into the house, where he
      soon came to his senses. It was not very much in that way he had to come
      to; but if Johnny had not many brains, he had an extraordinarily thick
      skull. The blow with the hammer would have killed another man, but it only
      made a bump on the head of our Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer asked him where he came from and what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to Hergnies, to eat roast goose,&rsquo; said Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you are twelve miles from Hergnies,&rsquo; said the farmer; and he gave
      Johnny a sheaf of corn, and sent him on his road.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 [Illustration: 8046]
</pre>
    <p>
      Well, Johnny lost himself again, and sat down against a wall and lunched
      off part of his hunch of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0023" id="linkimage-0023"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      Then, as he was tired, he fell asleep, and a chicken came and ate all the
      grains of corn out of his sheaf. Then Johnny woke, and when he found he
      had nothing left of his sheaf but straw he fell a-crying.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Now, the farmer there was a good-natured man, and, to console Johnny, he
      made him a present of the fowl, and off he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0025" id="linkimage-0025"> </a>

    <p>
      About four in the afternoon Johnny was hungry again, and sat down to
      finish his hunch of bread with his chicken beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came a clumsy great cow, and trod on the chicken and crushed it flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny set off sobbing again. &lsquo;Never no luck,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;They gave me a
      sheaf, and a chicken ate it. They gave me a chicken, and a cow crushed it
      Boo-hoo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width:10%;">

    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t boo-hoo,&rsquo; says the Lord of the Manor, who came by with his gun on
      his shoulder and his game-bag on his back. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t boo-hoo! take the cow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you kindly, your noble worship,&rsquo; says Johnny, as merry as may be,
      and he and the cow jogged along till it grew dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Johnny came to another farm, and there the farmer took in him and
      his cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this farmer had a big pretty maid, as strong as a man, and he bade
      her milk Johnny&rsquo;s cow. But, as she milked, the cow switched its tail in
      her eyes and made her see quite an illumination.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The maid was an angry maid. She picked up a pitchfork and threw it at the
      cow, and the poor beast fell down dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Johnny began to cry again, and I don&rsquo;t wonder at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never no luck,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;They gave me a sheaf, and a chicken ate it;
      they gave me a chicken, and a cow crushed it; they gave me a cow, and the
      maid killed it. Boo-hoo!&rsquo;

      href="images/8050.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh bother! take the maid and don&rsquo;t blubber,&rsquo; said the farmer. He didn&rsquo;t
      like to keep a girl in the house who threw pitchforks about when she lost
      her temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny did not wait to be asked twice. He took the maid, tied her hands
      and feet, put her in a sack, heaved her on to his back, and away went
      Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I do get to Hergnies,&rsquo; said he to himself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll marry the maid, and
      we&rsquo;ll have roast goose at the wedding supper,&rsquo; for his intentions were
      strictly honourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the further he went the more Johnny didn&rsquo;t find the way; and at last,
      as the maid was pretty heavy, he set her down by a tavern door and went in
      and asked for a pot of beer.

      OW, in the tavern were Tuné, the tailor, with a coat he had made for a
      customer, and Nanasse, and Polydore, and Rumble his dog, four of the
      wildest wags in that country-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuné went out of the tavern to see what kind of night it was, and there
      was the sack and something in it that moved. So he opened the sack, and
      what should he find but a pretty tall maid, trussed like a fowl.

      Well, he let her out and she told him all about it, and, as she was not
      dying to marry our Johnny, off she ran to her own village as hard as she
      could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to fill the sack with?&rsquo; thought Tuné. &lsquo;By George, I&rsquo;ll put in
      Polydore&rsquo;s yellow dog, Rumble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he whistled to Rumble and put him in the sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Johnny had finished his ale, and he came out, hoisted the
      sack on his shoulder, and marched away without asking questions. Tune
      followed at a little distance, and, as Rumble knew a friend was there,
      why, he entered into the fun and said never a bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Johnny reached Hergnies, and where should he go to but to the
      parson&rsquo;s, of course, to get married! Then it occurred to him that he had
      never asked the maid if she would have him! He put down the sack and
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, maid,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;shall us get married, us two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;G-r-r-r-r-r-r!&rsquo; says the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny, in a fright, let go his hold of the cord, the sack fell open, out
      jumped Rumble, and flew at his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny sprang into a willow-tree and climbed up it, but, lo and behold!
      the tree was rotten, and down came tree and Johnny and all on the back of
      Rumble! Now, Rumble was expecting nothing of that sort, and, with one wild
      yowl, he flew away like the wind, and never stopped till the town gates of
      Condé were closed behind him!

      HEN once the voice of Rumble was lost in the distance, Johnny climbed out
      of the tree and found that none of his bones were broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden in the hollow of the tree trunk he saw something shining
      like a will o&rsquo; the wisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put in his hands and pulled out A Goose with Golden Feathers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s luck at last,&rsquo; says Johnny, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost a maid and found a golden
      goose! I&rsquo;ll have it roasted this very night,&rsquo; and off he went to the best
      inn in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the inn was full of people going to the fair on St. Calixtus&rsquo;s day,
      which was a great festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Johnny, being but a village idiot, had never heard anything about
      all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up he comes and goes to the landlord, who didn&rsquo;t know where to turn, he
      had so many customers, all going to the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cook my goose!&rsquo; says Johnny, as bold as brass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you go to&mdash;Jerusalem,&rsquo; says the landlord, &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t cook <i>gold

    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so hot I really can&rsquo;t sleep,&rsquo; said she, and went on tip-toe to the

    <p>
      In the moonlight the golden goose was shining like a star.

    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take one of the pretty feathers,&rsquo; said the girl, and put out her

      sister. But as soon as she had touched her <i>she</i> could not move a
      step from the place!

      Then the third cock crew, and up got the youngest daughter, and ran to the
      stable after her sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care! don&rsquo;t come here!&rsquo; they cried, but she did not understand, and
      she thought&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, if they are there, I can go too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as she touched her sisters, there she was, as fast as could be
      to the golden goose!
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later Johnny wakened, and stretched himself, and
      shook some of the straw out of his hair, and then took his goose under his
      arm, and off he went, never noticing the girls, whom he had <i>not</i>
      left behind him.

      goose, and he ran, and they ran, and they all ran as fast as their legs
      would carry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were out of the village, the girls were also out of breath, and
      they entreated Johnny to stop. So he said he would stop if they would show
      him the right road, and the sun was up by the time they reached the next
      village.

      UST at that very moment, who should come by who should come by but the
      Vicar of Condé, with his two Curates, the Churchwardens, the Beadle
      himself, the man that played the fiddle, the man that played the cornet,

      Naturally, when he saw the landlord&rsquo;s daughters all strutting away behind

      They would not have been funny, but very pitiful, if they had really been

      NOW you must be told that the King of that country had a daughter <i>as
      lovely as the day,</i> who had never laughed in all her life!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as sad and sorry as the mournful Bell that rings for a death, and
      so they called her the <i>Passing Belle</i>; it was a sort of joke. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  The French country people call the Passing Bell La
     Dolente, and this unhappy Princess they named La Belle
     Dolente. If any child cannot understand this, she may
     consult her nice French grammar, and her French and English
     dictionary, and turn it over in her mind till next
     Christmas.

      Now, as she was an only child, the &lsquo;Passing Belle had been spoiled from
      her very cradle. Cakes, toys, diversions, such as playing at funerals, had
      been lavished on her, but she never, never smiled.

      They tried her with Punch and Judy, they tried her with pantomimes, they
      took her to the play, but there never came a smile on the pale lips of the
      Passing Belle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not have laughed for a King&rsquo;s ransom; nay, if you had ordered
      her off to instant execution, and laid her head on the block, you could
      not have wrung a smile from her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, who had a strong sense of humour, was in despair. Finally he had
      a proclamation printed:&mdash;

      Then the King, who was a very religious man, determined to take her to the
      shrine of Saint Calixtus. Of course, if the Saint could make her smile,
      she would become a nun, and perhaps, in the long run, would have been as

      LL the Court came, and all the Court nearly died with laughing at the
      procession of the halt, and lame, and blind. &lsquo;Go it, ye cripples,&rsquo; cried
      his Majesty, in convulsions of merriment! Some of the people were like
      X&rsquo;s, and some like Y&rsquo;s, and some like Z&rsquo;s, and plenty of K&rsquo;s and S&rsquo;s, all
      the cross letters were there, all the letters but straight upright I.
      Meanwhile the courtiers held their sides and screamed, and the tears came

      water! She did not see what there was to laugh at!
